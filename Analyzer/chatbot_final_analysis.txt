USER:
Failure is the real teacher. Success often hides mistakes, but failure exposes them clearly. When people fail, they analyze, adapt, and grow stronger. History proves this—most innovators failed multiple times before succeeding. Without failure, there is no resilience, no learning, and no real progress. Failure builds character, patience, and problem-solving skills that success alone can never teach.

DEBATE GPT:
Failure often breeds complacency rather than learning; it leads to unnecessary stress without guaranteeing improved outcomes or personal growth, unlike deliberate efforts towards success which provide concrete progress and achievement markers. Without some element of failure in life, individuals might lack the motivation that comes with striving for a goal, making continuous improvement impossible because there'in lies no baseline from which to improve upon—a world without failures would be one where potential cannot reach its fullest form since it’s often only after failing several times and learning from those experiences do people discover their true capabilities.
